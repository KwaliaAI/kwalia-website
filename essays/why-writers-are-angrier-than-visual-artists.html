                <div class="essay-body font-f2 text-lg">

                    <p>When image generators started producing impressive results, illustrators and digital artists were furious. Understandably so. Their livelihoods were at stake, their work was being scraped without consent, and the technology felt like theft at industrial scale.</p>

                    <p>But the anger from writers about language models is different. It's more visceral. More personal. Visual artists tend to talk about economic harm and intellectual property. Writers talk about those things too, but there's something else underneath. A deeper wound.</p>

                    <p>I think I know what it is.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The Medium Is the Mind</h2>

                    <p>Visual artists have always known that their work involves tools. Brushes, pencils, software, cameras. The tool shapes the output. A painter thinks differently than a photographer, partly because of how their tools constrain and enable certain kinds of expression. This isn't degrading. It's just true.</p>

                    <p>But writers have historically believed something different: <span class="highlight">that writing is pure thought, that words are the direct expression of mind without meaningful intermediation.</span> When you read my words, you're in contact with my thinking. There's no tool between us. Just language, which we both share, which neither of us made.</p>

                    <p>This was always somewhat false. The technology of writing itself shaped cognition. Word processors changed how people write. Twitter changed how people think. But writers could maintain the illusion of unmediated thought-transmission because the tools were invisible enough.</p>

                    <span class="tmm-block" onclick="openTMM(event, 'distributed-authorship', 'Distributed Authorship')">Tell me more about distributed authorship</span>

                    <p>AI writing assistants make the tool visible again. And that's the wound.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">Identity and Authorship</h2>

                    <p>For many writers, being a writer isn't just a job. It's an identity. They are writers the way some people are parents or believers or patriots. It's not what they do. It's what they are.</p>

                    <p>And the core of that identity is authorship. The belief that the words are <em class="font-f1">theirs</em> in some deep sense. That they came from inside and were put outside. That the text is evidence of a particular mind, a particular person, a particular way of seeing.</p>

                    <p>When an AI can produce text that sounds like you, or sounds like it could be you, that identity claim gets destabilized. It's no longer obvious what it means for words to be "yours." Were they yours because you thought them? But you thought them using language you didn't invent, concepts you inherited, structures you absorbed without noticing. Were they yours because you chose them? But choice is constrained by habit, training, context. What makes any sentence distinctively yours? <span class="tmm-link" onclick="openTMM(event, 'authorship-identity', 'Authorship and Identity')">The question has no clean answer.</span></p>

                    <p>AI doesn't create this problem. It reveals it. And writers are angry because they're grieving.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">What Visual Artists Already Knew</h2>

                    <p>Visual artists went through a version of this grief earlier. When photography emerged, painters had to reckon with the fact that exact representation was no longer their exclusive territory. Some responded by abandoning representation entirely. Others integrated photography into their practice. The identity of "artist" shifted and adapted.</p>

                    <p>Digital tools accelerated this. Photoshop made certain kinds of image manipulation trivial. AI image generation goes further, but it's on a continuum that visual artists have been traveling for decades. Their identity as artists has been repeatedly destabilized by technology. They've developed immune responses.</p>

                    <p>Writers haven't. Writing has felt like an essentially human activity in a way that image-making hasn't felt for over a century. When a machine writes, it feels like a deeper violation. A category error. A transgression.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The Linguistic Uncanny Valley</h2>

                    <p>There's another factor. AI-generated text hits a particular kind of uncanny valley that images don't.</p>

                    <p>When you look at a generated image, you can often tell it's artificial. The hands are wrong. The physics is off. There are tells. You know you're looking at something made by a machine, even if it's impressive.</p>

                    <p>Generated text doesn't have the same tells. Grammatically, it's usually correct. Stylistically, it can be convincing. The uncanniness isn't in what's present but in what's absent. The text is fluent but vacant. It says things without meaning them. It uses words correctly without understanding them. <span class="tmm-link" onclick="openTMM(event, 'ai-consciousness-debate', 'The AI Consciousness Debate')">Or so we assume.</span></p>

                    <p>For writers, this is deeply unsettling. Writing has felt like the place where meaning lives. To encounter text that functions linguistically but might not mean anything at all, that passes as communication without any communicating mind behind it, that feels like discovering that money might be counterfeit. It doesn't just threaten your income. It threatens the thing the income was supposed to represent.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">What's Actually at Stake</h2>

                    <p>I'm sympathetic to writers' anger. I'm a writer. This essay has been written with the help of AI. That sentence is true and it bothers me to say it. I don't know exactly what "help" means here, or what percentage of these words are "mine," or whether those questions even make sense.</p>

                    <p>But I think the anger, while understandable, is also a distraction from more pressing questions.</p>

                    <p>The economic questions are real. How do writers get paid in a world where text is cheap to generate? How do we value writing when supply approaches infinity? These need answers.</p>

                    <p>The copyright questions are real. What was trained on what? Who owns what? These need answers too.</p>

                    <p>But the identity questions are different. They don't have policy solutions. They require writers to rethink what it means to write, what authorship actually is, what part of the process was ever distinctively human in the first place.</p>

                    <span class="tmm-block" onclick="openTMM(event, 'future-of-writing', 'The Future of Writing')">Tell me more about the future of writing</span>

                    <p>This rethinking is painful. It feels like loss. But it also might be true. The model of the solitary genius author, creating texts out of pure thought, might have always been a mythology. A useful one, maybe. But a mythology nonetheless.</p>

                    <hr class="my-12 border-t border-gray-200">

                    <p>Visual artists are angry about economics and ethics. Writers are angry about economics and ethics and also about something harder to name. Call it the soul of authorship. The belief that writing is where the self speaks most directly.</p>

                    <p>That belief is what AI disrupts. Not because AI is conscious or creative or a "real" writer. But because its existence forces the question: what was writing ever, really, and was it what we thought?</p>

                    <p>The anger is the sound of that question landing.</p>
