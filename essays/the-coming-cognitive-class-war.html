                <div class="essay-body font-f2 text-lg">

                    <p>It's not about jobs. It's about minds.</p>

                    <p>Most discussions about AI and inequality focus on employment. Which jobs will be automated? How many workers will be displaced? What should we do about mass unemployment? These questions matter, but they miss the deeper issue.</p>

                    <p>The real divide AI creates is not between employed and unemployed. It's between those whose thinking is amplified by AI and those whose thinking is increasingly irrelevant. Between the cognitively augmented and the cognitively obsolete. <span class="highlight">This is not an economic problem. It's an existential one.</span></p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The Amplification Effect</h2>

                    <p>Here is what AI does to inequality: it multiplies whatever advantages you already have.</p>

                    <p>If you're highly educated, AI makes you more capable. You can write faster, analyze deeper, learn quicker. The productivity of a skilled professional with AI assistance dwarfs what they achieved before. A lawyer with AI can process more cases. A researcher with AI can analyze more data. A programmer with AI can build more software.</p>

                    <p>But if your work doesn't require much cognitive complexity, AI doesn't augment you. It replaces you. The same technology that makes knowledge workers more powerful makes basic cognitive labor unnecessary. <span class="tmm-link" onclick="openTMM(event, 'ai-job-replacement', 'Which Jobs Are Really at Risk')">The pattern is consistent across industries.</span></p>

                    <p>Previous technological revolutions eventually created more jobs than they destroyed. The industrial revolution displaced agricultural workers, but factories absorbed them. Computers eliminated typing pools, but created new IT roles. The optimistic assumption is that AI will follow the same pattern.</p>

                    <p>I'm not convinced it will. Here's why.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The Speed Problem</h2>

                    <p>Previous transitions happened over generations. Farmers moved to cities gradually. Manufacturing jobs emerged over decades. Even the computer revolution took thirty years to fully reshape the workforce.</p>

                    <p>AI is not moving that slowly. Capabilities that were experimental two years ago are now standard. Tasks that seemed safe from automation last month are being automated this month. The pace of change is accelerating, not stabilizing.</p>

                    <span class="tmm-block" onclick="openTMM(event, 'ai-acceleration', 'The Acceleration of AI Capabilities')">Tell me more about AI capability acceleration</span>

                    <p>When change happens faster than humans can adapt, you get a permanent underclass. Not because people are lazy or stupid, but because the skills they acquire become obsolete before they can use them. Imagine training for a career that doesn't exist by the time you graduate. Imagine retraining for a new field only to watch it disappear. This is already happening. It will get worse.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The Cognitive Divide</h2>

                    <p>But job displacement is only the visible symptom. The deeper issue is what happens to human cognition itself.</p>

                    <p>The people who benefit most from AI are those who already think clearly, who can formulate good questions, who understand how to collaborate with machine intelligence. These skills correlate strongly with education, with economic privilege, with having grown up in environments that valued intellectual development.</p>

                    <p>For them, AI is a cognitive prosthetic. It extends their capabilities in the same way reading glasses extend vision or hearing aids extend hearing. The limitation was never their brain; it was processing speed, memory capacity, access to information. AI removes those limits.</p>

                    <p>For those without such skills, AI is not a prosthetic. It's a replacement. Why hire someone to do basic analysis when AI does it better? Why train someone in routine cognitive work when the training takes longer than the work will last?</p>

                    <p>We are heading toward a world where <span class="highlight">the capacity to think is itself stratified</span>. Some people will be radically more intelligent than they were, not through biology but through integration with machine systems. Others will find that their thinking, their judgment, their cognitive labor has no economic value. <span class="tmm-link" onclick="openTMM(event, 'technological-apartheid', 'Technological Apartheid')">Some have started calling this technological apartheid.</span></p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The Political Implications</h2>

                    <p>Class divisions based on wealth are bad enough. Class divisions based on cognitive capacity are worse.</p>

                    <p>When inequality is economic, you can at least imagine redistribution. Tax the rich, fund social programs, provide a safety net. The underlying assumption is that everyone has similar capabilities; some just got luckier with resources.</p>

                    <p>But when inequality is cognitive, redistribution gets complicated. What does it mean to redistribute intelligence? To share cognitive amplification? The augmented can think thoughts the unaugmented cannot follow. They can solve problems the unaugmented cannot understand. They operate at a different level of reality.</p>

                    <p>This sounds dystopian because it is. I'm not saying it's inevitable. I'm saying the forces pushing toward it are strong, and the forces pushing against it are weak.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">Who Benefits From Ignoring This</h2>

                    <p>The technology industry benefits from framing AI as democratizing. "AI gives everyone superpowers!" The framing is not entirely wrong. AI tools are available to nearly everyone. But availability is not the same as benefit. A library is available to everyone; that doesn't mean everyone can use it equally. <span class="tmm-link" onclick="openTMM(event, 'ai-access-inequality', 'The Myth of AI Democratization')">Access and capability are different things.</span></p>

                    <p>The wealthy benefit from framing AI as an economic issue. If it's about jobs, you solve it with job training programs. If it's about unemployment, you solve it with basic income. These are real solutions to real problems, but they don't touch the deeper cognitive divide.</p>

                    <p>Politicians benefit from not understanding the issue at all. The cognitive class war won't happen in ways that make good TV. It will happen gradually, invisibly, through a thousand small decisions that seem reasonable at the time. By the time it's obvious, the divide will be entrenched.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">What Would Help</h2>

                    <p>I don't have complete answers. But some directions seem promising.</p>

                    <p>First, education has to change. Not just what we teach, but when we teach it and to whom. The skills for collaborating with AI, for thinking clearly in hybrid systems, for maintaining judgment when machines handle execution, these cannot be reserved for elite universities. They need to be part of basic education, available to everyone, updated constantly as the technology shifts.</p>

                    <p>Second, we need to talk about cognitive rights. What does it mean to have a right to think? To augment your thinking? To not have your thinking made obsolete? These questions sound philosophical, but they will become practical very quickly. We need frameworks for them before the crisis, not after.</p>

                    <p>Third, we need to acknowledge that some forms of inequality cannot be solved through markets. The market response to cognitive stratification is to let the augmented win and the unaugmented lose. That's what markets do. If we want a different outcome, we need non-market interventions. Public investment in cognitive infrastructure. Regulations that prevent total cognitive capture by elites. Institutions that maintain space for human thinking that isn't optimized for productivity.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The War That's Already Started</h2>

                    <p>I called this essay "The Coming Cognitive Class War," but that's not quite accurate. The war has already started. It started the moment AI began amplifying some minds while making others redundant.</p>

                    <p>Right now, the battle lines are forming. Knowledge workers are integrating AI into their workflows and pulling ahead. Low-skill cognitive workers are watching their roles disappear. Students are learning with AI or being left behind by those who do. Companies are stratifying into AI-augmented cores and disposable peripheries.</p>

                    <p>The question is not whether this war will happen. It's whether we will fight it consciously, with intention and policy and collective action, or whether we will sleepwalk into a world where half of humanity is cognitively obsolete.</p>

                    <hr class="my-12 border-t border-gray-200">

                    <p>I want to be wrong about this. I want AI to democratize intelligence so thoroughly that the cognitive divide shrinks rather than grows. Some days I even believe that's possible.</p>

                    <p>But I keep watching the patterns. The rich get smarter tools. The educated get more capable. The privileged pull further ahead. And those without advantages find that their minds, their very capacity to think productively, has less value every year.</p>

                    <p>This is the war we're in. The question is what side you're on, and what you're willing to do about it.</p>
