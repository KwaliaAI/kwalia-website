                    <p>Social media isn't broken. It's working exactly as designed.</p>

                    <p>The U.S. Surgeon General declared loneliness a public health epidemic in 2023. Rates of reported loneliness have doubled since the 1980s. Young people, the most "connected" generation in history, report the highest levels of isolation. This isn't a coincidence. It's a business outcome.</p>

                    <p>Here's the mechanism: social media platforms make money by capturing your attention. The longer you scroll, the more ads you see. What keeps you scrolling? Emotional activation. What emotions are most activating? Envy, outrage, and inadequacy.</p>

                    <p>Envy is particularly useful. When you see someone's curated life, someone's perfect vacation or perfect relationship or perfect apartment, you feel a pang of dissatisfaction with your own. That dissatisfaction is uncomfortable. And discomfort keeps you scrolling, looking for something that will make you feel better, which generates more content that makes you feel worse. <span class="tmm-link" onclick="openTMM(event, 'envy-as-resource', 'Envy as a Business Resource')">The cycle is profitable.</span></p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The Attention Machine</h2>

                    <p>Think about what the algorithm is optimizing for. Not your wellbeing. Not your social connections. Engagement. Time on platform. Clicks. These metrics correlate with emotional intensity, not emotional health.</p>

                    <p>The system is smart enough to know that showing you your friend's mundane Tuesday won't keep you scrolling. But showing you someone's highlight reel, someone who seems to be living the life you want, that works. Showing you content that makes you angry at an outgroup? Even better. <span class="highlight">The algorithm doesn't hate you. It doesn't care about you at all.</span> It's just optimizing a number, and you're the input.</p>

                    <span class="tmm-block" onclick="openTMM(event, 'attention-capture-mechanics', 'How Attention Capture Works')">Tell me more about how attention capture works</span>

                    <p>The result is a feed designed to provoke, not connect. You're seeing the content most likely to make you feel something intense, not the content most likely to make you feel good. And over time, this warps your sense of reality. Everyone else seems to be thriving. Everyone else seems to have it figured out. You're the only one struggling in the dark.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">Connection Without Intimacy</h2>

                    <p>Social media offers a strange substitute for real connection: the parasocial relationship. You follow someone. You see their updates. You feel like you know them. But they don't know you exist. It's intimacy flowing in one direction, like a river that only goes downstream.</p>

                    <p>This feels like connection because our brains weren't designed to distinguish between seeing someone on a screen and seeing someone in person. The same neural circuits fire. The same hormones release. But something is missing. Real intimacy requires reciprocity. It requires being known, not just knowing. <span class="tmm-link" onclick="openTMM(event, 'parasocial-relationships', 'Parasocial Relationships')">Parasocial bonds can't provide that.</span></p>

                    <p>So we end up in a peculiar position: more aware of more people than any humans in history, and more lonely. We have a thousand acquaintances and no one to call at 2am. We know what our high school classmates ate for breakfast but not whether they're happy.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The Isolation Flywheel</h2>

                    <p>Here's where it gets darker. Loneliness itself drives engagement. When you're lonely, you're more likely to seek out social connection wherever you can find it. For many people, that means their phone. Which means more scrolling, which means more exposure to the content designed to make you feel inadequate, which means more loneliness.</p>

                    <p>The platforms know this. Internal research at Meta showed that Instagram made teenage girls feel worse about their bodies. They published none of it voluntarily. When it leaked, the response was defensive spin. The product wasn't changed. Why would it be? The mechanism that makes teens feel bad is the same mechanism that keeps them scrolling. <span class="tmm-link" onclick="openTMM(event, 'facebook-files', 'The Facebook Files')">The leaked documents were damning.</span></p>

                    <p>I don't think there's a conspiracy here. Nobody in a boardroom said "let's make kids lonely so they use our app more." They just built systems that optimize for engagement, and it turned out that loneliness and engagement are correlated. The harm is emergent, not planned. But it's harm nonetheless.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">Not Broken, Functioning</h2>

                    <p>The standard narrative is that social media has bugs that need fixing. If we just tweak the algorithm, add some friction, implement better moderation, it'll be fine.</p>

                    <p>I don't think that's right. The loneliness isn't a bug. It's an outcome of the core business model. As long as platforms make money from attention, they'll be incentivized to capture as much attention as possible. And the most reliable way to capture attention is to provoke emotion. And the most reliable way to provoke emotion is to make people feel inadequate, outraged, or afraid.</p>

                    <p>You can't fix this with UI tweaks. You'd have to change the business model. Which means you'd have to change how these companies make money. Which means you'd have to make them less profitable. I don't see anyone volunteering for that.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">What We're Trading</h2>

                    <p>Every hour you spend scrolling is an hour you're not spending with someone in the same room. Every parasocial relationship is time not invested in reciprocal ones. Every dopamine hit from a like is a small withdrawal from the deeper satisfaction of being actually known.</p>

                    <p>This isn't moralistic finger-wagging. I'm on these platforms too. We all are. The design is effective precisely because it works with our psychology, not against it. The question isn't whether you're weak for being affected. The question is what you do once you see the mechanism.</p>

                    <hr class="my-12 border-t border-gray-200">

                    <p>The loneliness epidemic isn't happening despite our technology. It's happening, in part, because of how our technology is designed. We built machines that turn human attention into money, and it turns out that anxious, inadequate, lonely people pay a lot of attention.</p>

                    <p>I don't have a clean solution. Individual choices to log off help, but they don't change the system. Regulation could help, but regulators barely understand the technology. The companies won't fix themselves because the problem is the business model.</p>

                    <p>What I do know is that recognizing the mechanism is the first step. The loneliness you feel after scrolling isn't your fault. It's the point. The product is working exactly as intended. Your dissatisfaction is someone else's quarterly earnings.</p>

                    <p>What you do with that knowledge is up to you.</p>
