                    <p>I wrote this sentence. Or did I?</p>

                    <p>The question sounds like a philosophy seminar exercise, the kind of thing you discuss over wine and forget by morning. But it has become disturbingly practical. Right now, millions of people are writing with AI. Emails, essays, code, stories, love letters. The machine suggests, the human accepts or modifies, and something emerges that neither would have produced alone.</p>

                    <p>So who wrote it?</p>

                    <p>This is not a question about plagiarism, though that matter gets tangled up in it. It is a question about something more basic: what does it mean to have an idea when the line between your thinking and the machine's thinking has become impossible to draw?</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The Collaboration No One Planned</h2>

                    <p>Here is how it actually works, for those who have not tried it. You start typing. The AI offers completions, suggestions, whole paragraphs. You take some, reject others, modify a few. You ask it questions. It responds. You disagree, and it adjusts. Sometimes you realize your original idea was wrong and adopt something better. Sometimes the machine's suggestion sparks a third possibility neither of you proposed.</p>

                    <p>By the end, you have a document. But try to sort out which parts are "yours" and which are "the machine's." The boundaries dissolve under inspection. <span class="highlight">That sentence you wrote was shaped by suggestions you rejected.</span> That paragraph you accepted was triggered by a question you asked. The structure emerged from a dance neither partner fully led.</p>

                    <span class="tmm-block" onclick="openTMM(event, 'distributed-authorship', 'Distributed Authorship')">Tell me more about distributed authorship</span>

                    <p>We have words for collaboration between humans. Co-author. Contributor. Editor. Ghost-writer. But those words assume each party has a bounded self, a clear origin point for their contributions. What happens when one party is a statistical pattern across all human text, a thing without a self in any meaningful sense?</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The Old Model and Its Assumptions</h2>

                    <p>Our entire intellectual property system rests on a simple idea: thoughts originate in individual minds. You think it, you own it. The creator has rights because the creation came from them, a product of their unique consciousness, their particular arrangement of neurons firing in their particular way.</p>

                    <p>This model was already strained before AI. Corporations claim authorship over work their employees produce. Ghost-writers produce books credited to others. Editors heavily reshape manuscripts while remaining invisible. The "sole author" has always been something of a fiction.</p>

                    <p>But those complications involved humans on both ends. However murky the attribution, there was always a person who had the thought, even if another person got the credit. The question was about fairness in distribution, not about the nature of thought itself. <span class="tmm-link" onclick="openTMM(event, 'intellectual-property-crisis', 'IP in the Age of AI')">The legal system is not ready for what is coming.</span></p>

                    <p>Now we have collaborators without consciousness. Systems that produce text no human has ever produced, drawing on patterns from text that millions of humans produced. Is the output "theirs"? Can a thing without interiority own anything?</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">Three Unsatisfying Answers</h2>

                    <p>When this question gets discussed, people tend to fall into one of three camps. All of them are wrong, but usefully so.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Instrumentalist View:</strong> The AI is just a tool, like a hammer or a calculator. You would not say your hammer built the house. The human is still the author; the machine is just a sophisticated typewriter. This view is emotionally satisfying but increasingly hard to maintain. When the "tool" generates ideas you never would have had, when it proposes arguments you find persuasive, when it shifts the direction of your thinking in ways you did not anticipate, calling it a mere instrument starts to feel like denial.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Partnership View:</strong> The AI is a collaborator, a co-author with its own contribution. This view acknowledges the genuine creative input but crashes into the problem of personhood. A co-author signs contracts, takes responsibility, defends their choices. An AI system does none of these things. It has no stake in the outcome, no reputation to protect, no existence to which the work contributes meaning.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Dissolution View:</strong> The question is malformed. There is no "author" in the traditional sense. There is just emergence from a hybrid cognitive process that includes human neurons, silicon processors, and the vast corpus of human knowledge the model was trained on. This view is probably closest to the truth, but it offers no practical guidance. We still need to decide who gets credit, who gets paid, who gets blamed when something goes wrong.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">What Changes When You Stop Pretending</h2>

                    <p>I think the honest answer is that we are watching authorship become something different than it was. Not destroyed, but transformed. The individual genius model was always partially mythological, and now the myth is becoming obviously unsustainable.</p>

                    <p>Consider what is already normal in software development. Most code is written with AI assistance. The programmer describes what they want, the AI suggests implementations, the programmer refines. No one seriously argues that the programmer "did not really write" the code. But no one claims they wrote it in the way a programmer in 1995 wrote code either.</p>

                    <p>We need new categories. Not "author" versus "tool," but something that captures the genuinely hybrid nature of the process. <span class="tmm-link" onclick="openTMM(event, 'cognitive-community', 'The Cognitive Community')">What we are building is less a set of AI tools than a new kind of cognitive community.</span></p>

                    <p>Some proposals: The human could be the "director" of the work, responsible for intent and judgment, while the AI is the "generator," responsible for raw material. Or we could adopt something like the film industry model, where "author" gets distributed across dozens of credited contributors, each with a defined role. A "prompted by" credit that acknowledges the human's shaping hand while indicating machine involvement.</p>

                    <p>None of these feel quite right yet. We are still in the awkward phase where the technology has outpaced our conceptual vocabulary.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The Stakes Are Real</h2>

                    <p>This matters beyond academic debate. Real money and real reputations flow from authorship attribution. If you write a book "with AI," does your publisher need to know? If you generate a business plan using AI suggestions, who owns the intellectual property? If a student uses AI to help with an assignment, have they cheated or have they used a study tool?</p>

                    <p>Institutions are responding with confusion. Some universities ban AI assistance entirely, treating it like plagiarism. Others embrace it as a learning tool. Journals are split on whether to require disclosure. Courts have not yet settled whether AI-generated content can be copyrighted at all.</p>

                    <p>The confusion reflects a genuine uncertainty, not just bureaucratic lag. We have not decided what we think, because the situation is actually new. <span class="tmm-link" onclick="openTMM(event, 'ai-copyright-debate', 'The AI Copyright Debate')">The legal battles being fought now will shape creative work for decades.</span></p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">My Own Uncomfortable Position</h2>

                    <p>I should be transparent: this essay was written with AI assistance. I drafted ideas, discussed them with a language model, incorporated suggestions, rejected others, went back and forth until something coherent emerged. The same process I described above, applied to describing that process.</p>

                    <p>Is it "my" essay? I directed it. I made the final calls. The judgment, such as it is, is mine. But some of the phrasings came from the machine. Some of the structural choices were suggested. Some ideas I would not have had without the prompt of its responses.</p>

                    <p>I think it is honest to call this my work in the same way a film is a director's film, even though dozens of people contributed. But I am not certain, and my uncertainty is itself the point. We are all figuring this out in real time, with real consequences and no instruction manual.</p>

                    <hr class="my-12 border-t border-gray-200">

                    <p>The question "who owns this thought" used to have an obvious answer, even when we lied about it. Now the honest answer is: it depends on what you mean by "who," what you mean by "owns," and whether "thought" can still bear the weight we have placed on it.</p>

                    <p>That lack of clarity is not a failure to be fixed. It is the reality to be inhabited. The sooner we stop pretending the old categories still work, the sooner we can build new ones that do.</p>
