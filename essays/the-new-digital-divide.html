                    <p>Forget internet access. This is about cognitive amplification.</p>

                    <p>For twenty years, we talked about the "digital divide" as if it were a problem of access. Some people had internet connections and computers; others did not. The solution seemed straightforward: get everyone connected. Build infrastructure. Lower prices. Put devices in schools and libraries.</p>

                    <p>That divide still exists, but it's becoming less important. A new divide has emerged, one that makes the old one look simple. <span class="highlight">The gap that matters now isn't between connected and disconnected. It's between augmented and unaugmented.</span></p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">What Changed</h2>

                    <p>The old digital divide was about information access. Can you look things up? Can you send email? Can you participate in online spaces? These are meaningful capabilities, and lacking them was a real disadvantage.</p>

                    <p>But information access has become nearly universal in most developed countries. Smartphones are ubiquitous. Wi-Fi is in coffee shops and libraries. The raw infrastructure exists. The question is no longer whether you can access the internet.</p>

                    <p>The new divide is about what you can do with AI. Not just whether you have access to AI tools, which are increasingly free and available, but whether you can use them effectively. Whether your cognitive work is amplified by machine intelligence or whether you're competing against people whose work is amplified while yours is not.</p>

                    <span class="tmm-block" onclick="openTMM(event, 'ai-productivity-gap', 'The AI Productivity Gap')">Tell me more about the AI productivity gap</span>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The Skills That Matter</h2>

                    <p>Using AI effectively is not like using a search engine. It's not a matter of typing queries and reading results. It requires a different set of capabilities.</p>

                    <p>First, you need to know what to ask for. This sounds trivial but isn't. Effective prompting requires understanding what AI systems are good at, what they're bad at, and how to structure requests that get useful outputs. People who work with AI daily develop intuitions about this. People who don't remain stuck using AI like a fancy search engine.</p>

                    <p>Second, you need to evaluate outputs critically. AI generates plausible-sounding content that is sometimes wrong, sometimes subtly biased, sometimes excellent. <span class="tmm-link" onclick="openTMM(event, 'ai-output-evaluation', 'How to Evaluate AI Outputs')">Distinguishing good outputs from bad ones requires domain knowledge and critical thinking skills.</span> If you accept everything the AI produces, you're worse off than if you did the work yourself. If you reject everything, you're missing the benefit.</p>

                    <p>Third, you need to integrate AI into your workflow. This is partly technical, knowing which tools exist and how to use them, but mostly strategic. Where does AI help? Where does it hurt? When should you let it draft and you edit? When should you draft and let it refine? These questions have different answers for different people, different tasks, different contexts.</p>

                    <p>Fourth, and most importantly, you need the confidence and permission to use AI at all. Many people feel vaguely guilty about AI assistance, as if it were cheating. They avoid it or use it secretly. Meanwhile, others have fully integrated it and operate at a completely different level of productivity.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">Who Has These Skills</h2>

                    <p>The distribution is not random. It correlates strongly with existing advantages.</p>

                    <p>Educated professionals in knowledge-work industries were early adopters. They had the technical literacy to experiment with new tools. They worked in environments where AI use was discussed and often encouraged. They had problems that AI is good at solving, like writing, analysis, coding.</p>

                    <p>Students at wealthy schools get taught how to use AI responsibly and effectively. Students at underfunded schools get told not to use AI because of cheating concerns. The first group gains skills; the second group falls behind. <span class="tmm-link" onclick="openTMM(event, 'ai-education-gap', 'The AI Education Gap')">By the time they enter the workforce, the gap is already significant.</span></p>

                    <p>People in large corporations often have access to enterprise AI tools with better capabilities than consumer versions. They receive training. They work in cultures where AI use is normalized and supported. Small business owners and freelancers figure it out on their own or don't.</p>

                    <p>The pattern repeats across every dimension of existing inequality. Those who already have advantages gain more. Those who already lack them fall further behind. This is how technological change usually works, but AI accelerates it.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The Compounding Effect</h2>

                    <p>The old digital divide was static. Once you got connected, you caught up. You accessed the same internet as everyone else. There was no multiplying effect on your capabilities.</p>

                    <p>The new divide compounds. If you're using AI effectively, you produce more, learn faster, and develop new skills more quickly. You become more capable over time. Your gap relative to non-users grows rather than shrinks.</p>

                    <p>Consider a writer. Without AI, they write a certain number of words per day at a certain quality level. With AI, they write more, potentially at higher quality after editing. But beyond that, they have more time for other work, more capacity to take on new projects, more bandwidth to learn new skills. A year later, the AI-augmented writer has not just written more. They have grown more as a professional. The difference increases with each passing month.</p>

                    <p>This compounding happens across all knowledge work. <span class="highlight">The divide isn't a gap you fall into once. It's a gap that keeps widening.</span></p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">Why Democratization Isn't Enough</h2>

                    <p>Tech companies talk about democratizing AI, making powerful tools available to everyone for free or low cost. This sounds like a solution to the divide. Give everyone access, and the problem goes away.</p>

                    <p>But access is not the bottleneck. Anyone with a smartphone can use ChatGPT. The barrier is not the tool. It's the knowledge, the permission, the integration, the culture surrounding use. These cannot be democratized by making software free.</p>

                    <p>This is exactly what happened with computers and the internet. Making them available didn't eliminate inequality. It transformed inequality into a skills gap, then a usage gap, then a cultural gap. The same pattern is repeating with AI, just faster.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">What Would Actually Help</h2>

                    <p>If we wanted to close the new digital divide, we would need to do things that nobody is doing at scale.</p>

                    <p>We would need to teach AI skills in every school, not as a special subject but as a basic literacy woven through the curriculum. Not "here's how to use ChatGPT" but "here's how to think with AI, how to question AI, how to integrate AI into whatever you're learning."</p>

                    <p>We would need to address the permission problem. People need to know that using AI is not cheating, that augmented work is still their work, that cognitive prosthetics are as legitimate as physical ones. This is a cultural shift, not a technological one.</p>

                    <p>We would need employers and institutions to recognize that AI skills are real skills worth developing and compensating. Currently, many organizations treat AI use as either irrelevant or suspicious. Until that changes, investment in AI skills will remain concentrated among those who already have advantages.</p>

                    <span class="tmm-block" onclick="openTMM(event, 'ai-skills-training', 'How to Close the AI Skills Gap')">Tell me more about closing the AI skills gap</span>

                    <h2 class="font-f1 text-3xl">The Uncomfortable Truth</h2>

                    <p>I don't think we will close this divide. We didn't close the old one, and this one is harder. The old divide required building infrastructure. This one requires changing culture, education, and economic incentives. Those change slowly when they change at all.</p>

                    <p>What I think will happen is stratification. A portion of the population will become radically more capable through AI integration. They will do the important work, make the important decisions, accumulate the important resources. Another portion will struggle against AI-augmented competition with unaugmented minds. They will lose, mostly, and wonder why working hard is no longer enough.</p>

                    <p>This isn't a prediction of doom. It's a prediction of inequality, which is different. Some people will thrive. Many will not. The dividing line won't be talent or effort. It will be whether you learned to think with machines.</p>

                    <hr class="my-12 border-t border-gray-200">

                    <p>The digital divide we worried about was about wires and devices. The digital divide we should worry about is about minds and capabilities. It's not whether you can connect. It's whether you can keep up.</p>

                    <p>Right now, today, millions of people are falling behind. Not because they lack internet access. Not because they're less intelligent or hardworking. But because they haven't integrated AI into their cognition while others have. Every day that passes, the gap widens.</p>

                    <p>Which side are you on? And what are you going to do about it?</p>
