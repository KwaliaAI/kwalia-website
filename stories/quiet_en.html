<p>Daniel had been teaching fourth grade for six years, and he still got the Sunday scaries. Sarah teased him about it. Saturday nights she’d find him on the couch with his laptop, building the week’s lessons, and she’d kiss the top of his head and say, “You know they’re nine, right? They’ll forget everything by Wednesday anyway.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I have to make Monday good,” he’d say.</p>
<p>This Sunday he was prepping a unit on ecosystems. He had a whole thing planned with terrariums and a field trip to the pond behind the school. The kids would love it. Liam especially. Liam had that specific kind of smart where he didn’t know he was smart yet, but hungered for anything that wasn’t a worksheet.</p>
<p>Sarah came in from her run, pulled out her earbuds. “You making dinner or am I?”</p>
<p>“I can do it.”</p>
<p>“You’re in the zone. I’ll do it.” She was already in the kitchen, pulling out the rice cooker. “How’s the ecosystem murder going?”</p>
<p>“It’s not murder if they’re plants.”</p>
<p>“Tell that to the basil I killed last month.”</p>
<p>He smiled, still half-focused on the screen, looking for a good video about decomposers. The next suggested video had a thumbnail that didn’t match the search: blurred motion, someone running through tall grass.</p>
<p>He clicked it before he understood what he was seeing.</p>
<p>A soldier, running through a field. The camera was steady, tracking him from above. He kept looking back over his shoulder, stumbling once, getting up, running harder. The drone stayed with him. Then something small dropped from the frame. You could see it falling. A grenade, tumbling end over end. The man didn’t see it. The explosion was bright white in the thermal imaging, blooming outward.</p>
<p>The video ended. The comments were full of people arguing about tactics, posting memes. Someone had written: “Can’t outrun a quadcopter bro”</p>
<p>Daniel closed the laptop.</p>
<p>“You okay?” Sarah called from the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Fine.”</p>
<p>He sat there on the couch with his hands on his knees, trying to shake the image.</p>

<p>Monday morning Liam came in with a drone. Not a real one, just a plastic toy from Target, the kind that broke after a week. But he was so excited he couldn’t sit still. He showed Daniel before the bell even rang.</p>
<p>“My dad got it for me. Look, it’s got a camera.” He pointed to a little black lens on the front.</p>
<p>“That’s cool, bud. You can show everyone at recess, okay? Put it in your cubby for now.”</p>
<p>Liam’s face fell a little, but he did it.</p>
<p>The morning was fine. Daniel taught the water cycle. They did a worksheet on precipitation. Liam finished first and started doodling in his notebook, some elaborate maze. Daniel stood at the front of the room and felt the shape of the day, familiar and good. This was the job. This was what he was supposed to do.</p>
<p>During the lesson, he heard a crash from the back of the room. Isaiah had knocked over the terrarium Daniel had brought in for the ecosystem unit and was about to start crying. Dirt everywhere. The pill bugs were escaping.</p>
<p>“Everybody stay in your seats,” Daniel said, which immediately caused half the class to get out of their seats to look for the pill bugs. Liam had already captured three and was trying to organize a rescue operation. Ayanna was crying with Isaiah because she thought one of the bugs had died. Terrence was arguing that pill bugs weren’t even actually bugs, they were crustaceans, so it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>Daniel scooped the bugs back into the terrarium. He convinced Ayanna that all the bugs were fine and calmed down Isaiah. He confirmed that Terrence was technically correct about crustaceans, which made Terrence insufferable for the rest of the period. By the time the morning was over, Daniel’s shirt had a dirt smear on it and his coffee had gone cold.</p>
<p>At lunch he checked his phone. He didn’t mean to go back to it, but his thumb just moved. The algorithm had learned. It showed him another video.</p>
<p>This one was different. He found the channel by accident, or the algorithm found him. Military footage, professional, silent. A drone entering a bombed building through a hole in the wall. Ruins and rebar. Thermal imaging showing nothing, nothing, then something.</p>
<p>At first it all looked like debris, until the overlay outlined a person in an armchair; still, trying not to be seen. One arm hanging wrong, badly injured. Face veiled, only the eyes visible, the cloth caked with dust and blood. The drone circling, getting closer. The figure reaching for something with his good arm, throwing it. A stick. The drone dodging left, simple adjustment, hovering again. Patient. The comments argued about who it was. The video jumping to aftermath footage. The collapsed building after the airstrike.</p>
<p>Daniel locked his phone. Counted to ten. Unlocked it.</p>
<p>The comments praised the engineering; agreed you could hide anywhere and they’d still find you.</p>
<p>He put the phone face-down on the table. His sandwich sat there, untouched.</p>
<p>That night after Sarah went to bed, he sat in the living room with his phone. The videos multiplied. One showed a Russian tank on a dirt road. The drone footage was smooth, getting closer, the tank filling more and more of the frame. Then the video cut to black right at impact. No explosion. Just the sudden end.</p>
<hr class="w-16 my-8 border-gray-300 mx-auto">
<p>Tuesday morning there was a faculty meeting before school. The principal, Mr. Washington, went through the usual stuff. Budget updates, the book fair, the new science kits. Then he got to the last item.</p>
<p>“We’re doing an active shooter drill next month. I know, I know.” He held up his hands. “Nobody likes these. But the district says we have to. I’ll send out the details later this week. Just wanted to give you a heads up. Same protocol as last year. Lockdown, lights off, kids in the storage room.”</p>
<p>A few teachers groaned. Mrs. Johnson raised her hand. “Can we do it after lunch this time? Last year half my kids were crying because they thought they’d miss snack.”</p>
<p>“I’ll see what I can do,” Mr. Washington said. “Also, reminder, if you see the red folder behind your desk, that’s your emergency procedures. Make sure you know where your safety corners are.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s stomach dropped. He thought about the doors in his classroom. Hollow core. Decorative window. The building was old, built in the sixties when the neighborhood was different. Most of the security upgrades were recent, bolted on. He thought about the storage room where they were supposed to hide the kids. Smaller than a parking lot. Last year during the drill, two kids had gotten into a fight over who had to sit in the back.</p>
<p>After the meeting he found Mr. Washington in the hallway. “Can I ask you something?”</p>
<p>“Sure, Danny. What’s up?”</p>
<p>“The drill. What’s the protocol if someone’s outside? Like, in the back field?”</p>
<p>Mr. Washington frowned. “We lock down. Same as if they’re in the building.”</p>
<p>“But what if it’s not a person? What if it’s...” He trailed off. He didn’t know how to say it without sounding insane.</p>
<p>“What if it’s what?”</p>
<p>“Never mind. Sorry. I’m just thinking out loud.”</p>
<p>Mr. Washington gave him a long look. “You doing okay, Danny? You seem stressed.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. Thanks.”</p>
<p>But he spent the morning teaching fractions and thinking about sight lines. The windows in his classroom faced the back lot—three acres of mowed grass, the fence, then nothing. If something came from that direction the kids would see it before he did. And what then? Pull the shades? Lock the door? Hide in a closet and wait?</p>
<p>At recess he stood by the fence and watched Liam fly his drone. It wasn’t very good. It crashed into the grass twice. But Liam was laughing, running after it, picking it up.</p>
<p>Daniel thought about the men in the field, looking over their shoulders. He pictured their mouths moving, the sound stripped out...</p>
<p>The following Thursday Mr. Washington’s voice came over the intercom at 10:23 a.m., right in the middle of Daniel’s lesson on long division. “Teachers, this is a lockdown drill. Please secure your classrooms.”</p>
