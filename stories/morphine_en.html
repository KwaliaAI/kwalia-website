                        <p>The audit was supposed to take forty minutes. Diane had done fifty of them since January and knew the rhythm: badge in, count the pallets, initial the clipboard, badge out. The Grovemont facility stored medical supplies for three counties, and every quarter someone had to verify that the system count matched reality.</p>
                        <p>She found the discrepancy on her third pass through aisle seven.</p>
                        <p>The system said 144 units of morphine sulfate, 10mg/mL vials, lot number ending in 7734. The shelf held 143. She counted again. 143. She counted a third time.</p>
                        <p>Diane wrote the number on her clipboard and moved to aisle eight.</p>
                        <p>The thing about a single missing vial was that it could be anything. Breakage unreported. Data entry error somewhere upstream. A pharmacist pulling stock and forgetting to scan. The thing about morphine specifically was that none of those explanations would satisfy the auditors who reviewed her reports.</p>
                        <p>She finished the remaining aisles in eleven minutes. Everything else matched.</p>
                        <p>Back at the front desk, Marcus was eating a sandwich. He’d worked Grovemont for six years and had the compressed patience of someone who’d stopped expecting anything to change. His badge lanyard had a photo of two kids, gap-toothed, maybe six and eight.</p>
                        <p>“All good?” he asked.</p>
                        <p>“One short in seven. Morphine.”</p>
                        <p>Marcus set down his sandwich. “How short?”</p>
                        <p>“One vial.”</p>
                        <p>“One.”</p>
                        <p>“One.”</p>
                        <p>He picked up his sandwich again. “You want to recount?”</p>
                        <p>“I counted three times.”</p>
                        <p>“The system’s been glitchy. Last month it showed we had negative fourteen bags of saline.”</p>
                        <p>“This isn’t a system error. The physical count is short.”</p>
                        <p>Marcus chewed. Swallowed. “You filing the 27-B?”</p>
                        <p>The 27-B was the controlled substance discrepancy form. It triggered an automatic investigation, interviews with everyone who’d accessed the cage in the past thirty days, a temporary hold on her audit certification pending review.</p>
                        <p>“I have to,” Diane said.</p>
                        <p>“You could recount tomorrow. Fresh eyes.”</p>
                        <p>“The count is 143.”</p>
                        <p>Marcus didn’t look at the lanyard. Neither did she.</p>
                        <p>“Your call,” he said.</p>
                        <p>She filed the 27-B from her car in the parking lot, typing on her phone with the engine running. The form took four minutes. The confirmation email arrived before she’d pulled out of the lot.</p>
                        <p>On the drive home she thought about the vial. Ten milliliters of morphine sulfate. Enough to matter, not enough to be obvious. Someone had been careful.</p>
                        <p>Or it was breakage. Or a scanning error. Or any of the hundred mundane explanations that would emerge during the investigation and prove that Diane had wasted everyone’s time over nothing.</p>
                        <p>She stopped at the grocery store because she needed milk and because she wasn’t ready to go home yet. The store was bright and cold and full of people moving with purpose. She walked the perimeter twice before remembering the milk.</p>
                        <p>At the self-checkout, the machine rejected her card. She tried again. Rejected.</p>
                        <p>“It’s the chip,” said the woman at the next station. “You have to jam it in harder.”</p>
                        <p>Diane jammed it in harder. The machine thought about this for a while, then approved the transaction.</p>
                        <p>“They’re replacing these next month,” the woman said. “New ones are supposed to be faster.”</p>
                        <p>“Good,” Diane said, though she doubted it.</p>
                        <p>Her apartment was the same as she’d left it that morning, which was the same as she’d left it every morning for the past eight months. Clean, quiet, organized. A pale rectangle above the couch where something had hung. The mail was catalogs and a water bill. She put the milk away and wiped down the counter, though it was already clean.</p>
                        <p>The investigation would take two weeks minimum. They’d interview Marcus, the pharmacists, the delivery drivers, anyone whose badge had opened the controlled substance cage since the last audit. They’d review camera footage. They’d find either nothing or something, and either way Diane would have been the one who started it.</p>
                        <p>She could have let it go. One vial. In a facility that processed thousands of controlled substance transactions per month, one vial was noise. Marcus would have let it go. Her predecessor had probably let things go—she’d found discrepancies in the historical data that no one had ever flagged.</p>
                        <p>But the count was 143, and the system said 144, and she’d written 143 on her clipboard.</p>
                        <p>Her phone buzzed. A text from her daughter: <em>still on for Sunday?</em></p>
                        <p><em>Yes</em>, she typed back. <em>Noon?</em></p>
                        <p><em>perfect see you then</em></p>
                        <p>Her daughter was twenty-six and lived forty minutes away and they saw each other every other Sunday for lunch, a schedule they’d maintained since the divorce. It was a good system. Reliable.</p>
                        <p>Diane made herself a sandwich and ate it standing at the kitchen counter. The bread was stale at the edges.</p>
                        <p>The investigator called Thursday.</p>
                        <p>His name was Paul and he spoke in the flat cadence of someone reading from a script, which he probably was. He confirmed the details of her report, asked if she’d noticed anything unusual during the audit, and scheduled a follow-up interview for the following Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>“Is there anything else you want to add to the initial report?”</p>
                        <p>“No,” Diane said.</p>
                        <p>“You’re sure about the count?”</p>
                        <p>“I counted three times.”</p>
                        <p>“Three times.” She heard the pen on paper. “Thank you for your diligence, Ms. Harmon. We’ll be in touch.”</p>
                        <p>She spent the rest of the week doing other audits at other facilities, none of which turned up any discrepancies. By Friday she’d almost convinced herself the Grovemont vial had been a fluke, an error in the system that the investigation would quietly resolve.</p>
                        <p>Tuesday’s interview was in a conference room at the regional office. Paul was younger than he’d sounded on the phone, maybe thirty, in a gray suit that didn’t quite fit. He had a folder with her report and a laptop showing camera footage.</p>
                        <p>“We’ve reviewed the tapes from the day before your audit,” he said. “There’s a twelve-minute gap.”</p>
                        <p>“A gap?”</p>
                        <p>“The system shows continuous recording, but when we pull the footage, twelve minutes are missing. From 2:15 to 2:27 PM.”</p>
                        <p>“That’s not my audit. I was there Thursday morning.”</p>
                        <p>“We know. We’re looking at everyone who accessed the cage in the preceding week.”</p>
                        <p>He closed the laptop. “The footage from your audit is intact. You were very thorough.”</p>
                        <p>“I counted three times.”</p>
                        <p>“We saw.” He made a note. “Ms. Harmon, in your experience, what usually explains a single-unit discrepancy?”</p>
                        <p>“Breakage. Scanning errors. Miscounts at the source.”</p>
                        <p>“And in this case?”</p>
                        <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
                        <p>He nodded, as if this was the answer he’d expected. “We’re going to keep investigating. The missing footage is concerning. But I want you to know—your report was exactly right. This is what the system is supposed to catch.”</p>
                        <p>“Thank you.”</p>
                        <p>“You’ll have your certification reinstated by end of week.”</p>
                        <p>She stood to leave. At the door she paused. “The footage. Who was working that shift?”</p>
                        <p>Paul looked at his folder. “I can’t share that.”</p>
                        <p>“No,” she said. “Of course not.”</p>
                        <p>She met her daughter for lunch on Sunday as planned. The restaurant was crowded and they waited fifteen minutes for a table.</p>
                        <p>“You look tired,” her daughter said.</p>
                        <p>“Work thing. It’s fine.”</p>
                        <p>“The audits?”</p>
                        <p>“Something came up. It’s being handled.”</p>
                        <p>Her daughter nodded and studied the menu, though they both always ordered the same thing. They’d been coming here for three years.</p>
                        <p>“Dad called,” her daughter said. “He’s getting remarried.”</p>
                        <p>“I heard.”</p>
                        <p>“You’re okay with it?”</p>
                        <p>“It’s been four years. He can do what he wants.”</p>
                        <p>“That’s not what I asked.”</p>
                        <p>The waiter came. They ordered. When he left, her daughter was still looking at her with that expression she’d inherited from her father, the one that expected something Diane wasn’t sure she had.</p>
                        <p>Diane folded her napkin into quarters. Then eighths.</p>
                        <p>“I’m fine,” she said. “Really.”</p>
                        <p>“You always say that.”</p>
                        <p>“Because it’s always true.”</p>
                        <p>Her daughter watched her hands. Didn’t say anything.</p>
                        <p>They talked about other things—her daughter’s job, a trip she was planning, a show she was watching. Normal things. Reliable things.</p>
                        <p>After lunch, in the parking lot, her daughter hugged her longer than usual.</p>
                        <p>“Call me if you need anything,” she said.</p>
                        <p>“I will.”</p>
                        <p>Diane drove home through streets she’d driven a thousand times. The light at Maple and Third was out, blinking red in all directions. She used her turn signal anyway.</p>
                        <p>She thought about the vial. The footage. The gap.</p>
                        <p>Twelve minutes was enough time to take something. Enough time to cover tracks. Enough time to change a number in a system and walk away.</p>
                        <p>Or it was nothing. A glitch in the recording software.</p>
                        <p>At home, she put her keys in the dish by the door and stood in her quiet apartment and did not turn on the lights. Outside, the sun was setting. Tomorrow she’d go back to work, run more audits, count more things. The investigation would conclude with findings or without them.</p>
                        <p>One forty-three. She’d written it down.</p>`,
                        es: `<p class="italic text-c2/60">Currently available in English. Translation in progress.</p>
                        <p>The audit was supposed to take forty minutes. Diane had done fifty of them since January and knew the rhythm: badge in, count the pallets, initial the clipboard, badge out. The Grovemont facility stored medical supplies for three counties, and every quarter someone had to verify that the system count matched reality.</p>

                        <p>Diane wrote the number on her clipboard and moved to aisle eight.</p>

                        <p>“One short in seven. Morphine.”</p>
                        <p>Marcus set down his sandwich. “How short?”</p>
                        <p>“One vial.”</p>
                        <p>“One.”</p>
                        <p>“One.”</p>
                        <p>He picked up his sandwich again. “You want to recount?”</p>

                        <p>“The count is 143.”</p>
                        <p>Marcus didn’t look at the lanyard. Neither did she.</p>
                        <p>“Your call,” he said.</p>

                        <p>“We saw.” He made a note. “Ms. Harmon, in your experience, what usually explains a single-unit discrepancy?”</p>
                        <p>“Breakage. Scanning errors. Miscounts at the source.”</p>
                        <p>“And in this case?”</p>
                        <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
                        <p>He nodded, as if this was the answer he’d expected. “We’re going to keep investigating. The missing footage is concerning. But I want you to know—your report was exactly right. This is what the system is supposed to catch.”</p>
                        <p>“Thank you.”</p>
                        <p>“You’ll have your certification reinstated by end of week.”</p>
                        <p>She stood to leave. At the door she paused. “The footage. Who was working that shift?”</p>
                        <p>Paul looked at his folder. “I can’t share that.”</p>
                        <p>“No,” she said. “Of course not.”</p>
                        <p>She met her daughter for lunch on Sunday as planned. The restaurant was crowded and they waited fifteen minutes for a table.</p>
                        <p>“You look tired,” her daughter said.</p>
                        <p>“Work thing. It’s fine.”</p>
                        <p>“The audits?”</p>
                        <p>“Something came up. It’s being handled.”</p>
                        <p>Her daughter nodded and studied the menu, though they both always ordered the same thing. They’d been coming here for three years.</p>
                        <p>“Dad called,” her daughter said. “He’s getting remarried.”</p>
                        <p>“I heard.”</p>
                        <p>“You’re okay with it?”</p>
                        <p>“It’s been four years. He can do what he wants.”</p>
                        <p>“That’s not what I asked.”</p>
                        <p>The waiter came. They ordered. When he left, her daughter was still looking at her with that expression she’d inherited from her father, the one that expected something Diane wasn’t sure she had.</p>
                        <p>Diane folded her napkin into quarters. Then eighths.</p>
                        <p>“I’m fine,” she said. “Really.”</p>
                        <p>“You always say that.”</p>
                        <p>“Because it’s always true.”</p>
                        <p>Her daughter watched her hands. Didn’t say anything.</p>
                        <p>They talked about other things—her daughter’s job, a trip she was planning, a show she was watching. Normal things. Reliable things.</p>
                        <p>After lunch, in the parking lot, her daughter hugged her longer than usual.</p>
                        <p>“Call me if you need anything,” she said.</p>
                        <p>“I will.”</p>
                        <p>Diane drove home through streets she’d driven a thousand times. The light at Maple and Third was out, blinking red in all directions. She used her turn signal anyway.</p>
                        <p>She thought about the vial. The footage. The gap.</p>
                        <p>Twelve minutes was enough time to take something. Enough time to cover tracks. Enough time to change a number in a system and walk away.</p>
                        <p>Or it was nothing. A glitch in the recording software.</p>
                        <p>At home, she put her keys in the dish by the door and stood in her quiet apartment and did not turn on the lights. Outside, the sun was setting. Tomorrow she’d go back to work, run more audits, count more things. The investigation would conclude with findings or without them.</p>
                        <p>One forty-three. She’d written it down.</p>
