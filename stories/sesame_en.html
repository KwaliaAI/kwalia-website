<p>Connor found Ottolenghi on YouTube at 2 AM, couldn’t sleep because Tyler Briggs had shoved him into the girls’ bathroom again and everyone had filmed it.</p>
<p>The guy was making something called shakshuka with rose harissa, labneh, and za’atar. Connor had no idea what any of those words meant but watched him crack eggs into red sauce like it was something you could get wrong.</p>
<p>He made a list: harissa, labneh, za’atar, sumac, pomegranate molasses, preserved lemons, tahini that wasn’t Jif.</p>
<p>The Walmart in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, had none of these things.</p>
<p>“What’s lab-neh?” his mother asked, reading his list. She pronounced it like “lab” where you’d dissect frogs.</p>
<p>“It’s strained yogurt.”</p>
<p>“We have Yoplait.”</p>
<p>“Not the same.”</p>
<p>“Yogurt’s yogurt, Connor.”</p>
<p>She was trying. She’d been trying since Dad left, which meant double shifts at the distribution center and bringing home dented cans of whatever fell off the trucks. This week: forty-eight cans of water chestnuts.</p>
<p>Connor strained the Yoplait through a coffee filter overnight. It worked, sort of. Came out grainy but thick. He made the shakshuka with regular paprika and Sriracha instead of harissa, dried oregano instead of za’atar. Looked nothing like Ottolenghi’s.</p>
<p>Benji came over after school, like always. Benji who was five-foot-nothing and collected Magic cards and was the only other person at Harrison County High who’d never make it out alive.</p>
<p>“What’s this supposed to be?” Benji asked.</p>
<p>“Shakshuka.”</p>
<p>“Bless you.”</p>
<p>But he ate it. All of it. Mopped the sauce with Wonder Bread.</p>
<p>“It’s good,” he said. “Like fancy Spaghettios.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing like Spaghettios.”</p>
<p>“I meant that as a compliment.”</p>
<p>Connor’s phone had thirty-seven views of him being pushed into the girls’ bathroom. Someone had added music. “Dude Looks Like a Lady.”</p>
<p>He pulled up another Ottolenghi video. Lamb meatballs with feta and oregano. Served with tzatziki. He could maybe do this one.</p>
<p>“We don’t have lamb,” his mother said, going through Kroger’s meat section.</p>
<p>“Can we ask?”</p>
<p>She asked. The butcher, a man who’d gone to school with Connor’s dad, laughed.</p>
<p>“Lamb? This ain’t Whole Foods.”</p>
<p>They got ground beef. Seventy-thirty, the fattiest kind, because it was cheapest.</p>
<p>At home, Connor watched the video six more times. Ottolenghi talked about letting the meat rest, about not overworking it, about the importance of fresh herbs. Connor had dried oregano from 2019 and parsley that smelled like nothing.</p>
<p>The meatballs came out dense. The tzatziki was just sour cream with garlic powder and cucumber. But Benji showed up at 6 PM, reliable as gravity.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“Greek meatballs.”</p>
<p>“They look like regular meatballs.”</p>
<p>“They have feta in them.”</p>
<p>Benji took a bite, considered. “I can taste it. The feta.”</p>
<p>There was no feta. Connor had used shredded mozzarella.</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Definitely. It’s like... sharper? Is that the right word?”</p>
<p>“That’s the right word.”</p>
<p>They ate watching more Ottolenghi videos on Connor’s phone. The man was making something with black lime and baharat and rose petals.</p>
<p>“You could make that,” Benji said.</p>
<p>“I can’t get black limes in Kentucky.”</p>
<p>“Regular limes aren’t that different.”</p>
<p>“They’re completely different.”</p>
<p>“To who?”</p>
<p>Connor didn’t answer. To him. To anyone who knew. To Ottolenghi, who’d never have to substitute Sriracha for harissa or mozzarella for feta or live in a place where wanting to make food that wasn’t burgers or barbecue meant you were probably a faggot.</p>
<p>Tyler Briggs confirmed this the next day, writing it on Connor’s locker: “CHEF BOYARDICK.”</p>
<p>“Creative,” Benji said. “He managed to use both a gay joke AND a dick joke.”</p>
<p>“It’s not funny.”</p>
<p>“It’s a little funny. Chef Boyardick? Come on.”</p>
<p>Connor spent study hall looking up Middle Eastern grocery stores. The closest was in Louisville, forty minutes away. No car. His mom worked Saturdays.</p>
<p>But there was someone on Etsy selling preserved lemons. Eighteen dollars plus shipping for six lemons.</p>
<p>“For lemons?” his mother said. “Connor, they’re a dollar at Kroger.”</p>
<p>“These are different.”</p>
<p>“Different how?”</p>
<p>He couldn’t explain. They sat in salt for months. They turned into something else. They were what the recipe needed.</p>
<p>She gave him twenty dollars. Her tip money from the distribution center vending machines, people who felt bad she had to clean up their break room.</p>
<p>The preserved lemons took two weeks to arrive. Came in a mason jar wrapped in so much bubble wrap it took ten minutes to excavate. They looked like alien organs. Smelled like salt and flowers and something else, something that wasn’t Kentucky.</p>
<p>He made Ottolenghi’s chicken with preserved lemons and olives. Used thighs instead of a whole chicken. Kroger olives instead of Castelvetrano. But the preserved lemons were real.</p>
<p>Benji arrived at 6:30. He’d been shoved into a locker during fifth period and his shoulder hurt but he came anyway.</p>
<p>“Smells weird,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s supposed to.”</p>
<p>“No, I mean good weird. Like... somewhere else?”</p>
<p>That was exactly what it smelled like. Somewhere else.</p>
<p>They ate in Connor’s room because his mother was asleep on the couch, still in her work clothes. Benji gnawed the chicken down to bones.</p>
<p>“This is the best thing you’ve made.”</p>
<p>“It’s the first thing I’ve made with real ingredients.”</p>
<p>“They were all real.”</p>
<p>“You know what I mean.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t.” Benji looked at him. “The other stuff was good too. The Spaghettio thing—”</p>
<p>“Shakshuka.”</p>
<p>“That. The fake feta meatballs. The thing with the water chestnuts you tried to make Asian.”</p>
<p>“That was terrible.”</p>
<p>“I ate it.”</p>
<p>“You eat everything.”</p>
<p>“I eat everything you make.”</p>
<p>There was a difference but Connor couldn’t name it.</p>
<p>Tyler Briggs got suspended for three days for spray-painting something on the gym wall. Connor never found out what because the janitor covered it too fast. But everyone seemed to know it was about him and Benji. Benji pretending not to care. Connor pretending not to notice Benji was pretending.</p>
<p>His mother found him watching Ottolenghi at 3 AM.</p>
<p>“Can’t sleep?”</p>
<p>“He’s making muhammara.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Walnut and red pepper dip.”</p>
<p>“We have walnuts. From last Christmas.”</p>
<p>“It needs Aleppo pepper.”</p>
<p>“Where’s Aleppo?”</p>
<p>“Syria.”</p>
<p>“Jesus, Connor.”</p>
<p>But she drove him to Louisville that weekend. Forty minutes each way, gas they couldn’t afford. Found a place called Jerusalem Market. Connor stood in the spice aisle for twenty minutes, overwhelmed. Everything was here. Everything he’d been substituting.</p>
<p>“Twenty dollars,” his mother said. “Pick.”</p>
<p>He got sumac, za’atar, and Aleppo pepper. Wanted tahini but it was eight dollars. Wanted pomegranate molasses but it was twelve.</p>
<p>“I can make the tahini,” he told Benji later, grinding sesame seeds in his mother’s coffee grinder. It came out wrong, bitter and chunky. But Benji ate it on crackers.</p>
<p>“It’s good.”</p>
<p>“It’s not.”</p>
<p>“It’s yours. That makes it good.”</p>
<p>Connor kissed him. Didn’t mean to. Just did. Benji kissed back. Also didn’t mean to, probably. Just did.</p>
<p>“This doesn’t make us—” Benji started.</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“I mean, it does, but—”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>They watched Ottolenghi make whole roasted cauliflower with tahini. Connor’s tahini, the bitter stuff, was still on the counter. Getting darker. Separating.</p>
<p>“I could eat a whole cauliflower,” Benji said.</p>
<p>“No you couldn’t.”</p>
<p>“If you made it.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to say that.”</p>
<p>“I’m not. I just... I like watching you cook. You’re different when you cook.”</p>
<p>“Different how?”</p>
<p>“Like you know something nobody else knows.”</p>
<p>Connor looked beyond the wall.</p>
<p>Connor reached for his phone. “Next week, I’m making kibbeh.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“No idea. But Ottolenghi says it’s worth it.”</p>
<p>“Then it probably is.”</p>
<p>Benji’s shoulder still hurt. Connor could tell by how he was sitting. Tomorrow Tyler would be back from suspension. Tomorrow they’d have to walk the halls and eat lunch and pretend nothing had changed.</p>
<p>Connor’s tahini was still on the counter, separating into layers.</p>
<p>“You taste like sesame seeds,” Benji said.</p>
<p>“Is that bad?”</p>
<p>“No. Just specific.”</p>
<p>Connor laughed. Outside, his mother’s car ticked as it cooled. Forty minutes to Louisville, forty back, for three small bags of spices. Next week he’d try kibbeh, though he’d probably use beef instead of lamb, pecans instead of pine nuts. It would be wrong but also right. His wrong. His right.</p>
<p>Benji shifted, favoring his good shoulder. He smacked his lips, all sesame and Connor.</p>`,
